  <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>1914</b>- Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
    <li>
      <b>1933</b>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of
      Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth
      Administration"
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the
      Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food
      changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>1937 </b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry
      Service
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due
      to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school
      study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
    </li>
    <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
    <li>
      <b>1944 </b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind
      his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
      program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains
      of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
      climate on Earth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling
      wheat yields
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
      high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to
      fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
    </li>
  </ul>

    "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
    contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific
    vision can make to human peace and progress."
